# Data Ware House For Bike Share Analytics

Divvy is a bike sharing program in Chicago, Illinois USA that allows riders to purchase a pass at a kiosk or use a mobile application to unlock a bike at stations around the city and use the bike for a specified amount of time. The bikes can be returned to the same station or to another station. The City of Chicago makes the anonymized bike trip data publicly available for projects like this where we can analyze the data.

Since the data from Divvy are anonymous, we have created fake rider and account profiles along with fake payment data to go along with the data from Divvy. The dataset looks like this:
